# Python_GUI

An image processing GUI  written in python.

Nothing magical.

Just getting started on my personal project.

# Objective

The main objective of this image processing GUI is to provide a quick and dirty way for the effect of different algorithms including but not limited to:

1. Thresholding
2. Gaussian Blur
3. Denoise
4. Enhance
5. Canny Edge Detection etc.

# BE WARNED!

Although this program will run (hopefully), it has not been optimized nor has it been finialized.

# TO-DOs

1. Enable objection detection.
2. Labelling option (maybe?)
3. Color separation (WHOA)
4. Features Extraction (oh yea)
5. Image Search Engine (HOT!)

# Dependency

Standard python libraries for image processing which include:

* Matplotlib
* Opencv-python
* Numpy for calculation

[PySimpleGUI](https://pysimplegui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is used as the GUI engine for this project.
